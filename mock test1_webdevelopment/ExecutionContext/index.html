    <h1>Execution context</h1>
    <p>An execution context is an internal JavaScript concept that defines the environment in which code is executed. It
        contains all the necessary information for the JavaScript engine to execute code, including variables,
        functions, scope chain, and the value of the `this` keyword.
    <p>

        When JavaScript code is executed, it is processed within execution contexts. Each execution context can be
        associated with a specific scope and has a set of variables and functions accessible within that scope.
    </p>
    <p>

        JavaScript has three types of execution contexts:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>

            1. Global Execution Context:
        </strong>
        - The default execution context in which the entire JavaScript code runs.
        - It represents the global scope and is accessible throughout the entire code.
        - In a browser, the global execution context is associated with the global object `window`, while in Node.js, it
        is associated with the `global` object.
        - Variables and functions declared in the global scope are accessible from other execution contexts.
    </p>


    <p><strong>

            2. Function Execution Context:
        </strong>
        - Created whenever a function is called or invoked.
        - Each function invocation has its own function execution context, which includes the function's arguments,
        local variables, and a reference to its outer scope.
        - The function execution context allows the function to maintain its own set of variables without interfering
        with other functions or the global scope.
        - When a function is invoked, a new function execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack.
